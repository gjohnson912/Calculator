# Calculator
This is a calculator web application built using jQuery on the front end and Java with the Spring Framework on the back end.

## Running Locally
To run this application, you will need to have a Web Server (I used Tomcat v7.0). Once the application is running on the server, you can go to http://localhost:8080/calculator/app/ to reach the home page with the calculator UI available.
